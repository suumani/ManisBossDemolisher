# Manis Boss Demolisher（spec v.0.1.5）

[日本語版はこちら / Japanese version](README.ja.md)

## Overview

**Manis Boss Demolisher** is a mod designed to elevate  
**Demolishers from a local enemy into a planetary-scale threat**  
within the Space Age environment.

By launching rockets,  
the danger once confined to a single planet can spread beyond it.

This mod offers a world where  
**your progress itself creates new risks** —  
especially for those who truly appreciate Demolishers.

## Concept

A powerful boss does not necessarily need to be defeatable.

Some bosses are overwhelming and must be avoided.  
Others are strong, persistent, and return when you least expect them.

This mod evolves Demolishers in a *legitimate* way,  
without turning them into simple damage sponges or scripted events.

Rocket launches — symbols of progress and expansion —  
are no longer safe actions.

You will be forced to rethink the balance between  
carefully selected transport and mass logistics.

**Planetary progression order matters more than ever.**

## What This Mod Adds to the Game

- Actions taken on one planet affect the danger level of others  
- Demolishers are no longer passive enemies — they move and spread  
- Base design, planet selection, and rocket usage require long-term planning  

This is not merely a difficulty increase.  
It is a mod focused on **the weight of decision-making**.

## Example Gameplay Flow

1. You progress normally and launch rockets  
2. That action triggers anomalies on other planets  
3. On invaded planets, Demolisher activity intensifies  
4. You must choose whether to respond, delay, or abandon the planet  

These choices are **not reversible**.

This mod is not about simply adding stronger enemies.

It is about exploring the tension between
